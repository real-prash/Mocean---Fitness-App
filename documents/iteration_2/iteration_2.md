# Iteration 2

This iteration our main goal was implementing a new SQL database engine to our project. We also continued to devlop our code and implemented more user stories and features. We created a new coding conventions document to keep our code uniform and consistent.

### Features 
Finished: 
- Track Calorie and Food Intake

Started but not finished:
- Track Workouts
- Create a Workout Plan

Not started (low priority):
- Workout Recommendations
- Workout and Meal Sharing
- Meal Recommendations
- Create a Meal Plan

### User Stories
Finished:
- Track Custom Foods
- Track User Food Intake
- Track User Workouts

Started but not finished:
- Change Weight and Height

#### Notes
Users are now able to add custom foods to the database and these foods will appear in the newly added food search view. A real database has been fully implemented, it does not reset to default data upon restarting the app as requested in the rubric. Users can also track their workouts and they are stored in a workout database too.

For the next iteration we plan to clean up all of our technical debt, implement any final small features that the app needs, and finally polish everything for a final release.
