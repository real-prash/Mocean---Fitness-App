# Iteration 0 Retrospective

## Things that we could've done better:
- could've organized our files better initially
- could've thought longer about time estimates

## Things that went well:
- figured things out together as we went
- everyone felt comfortable contributing
- having a structured meeting time to discuss the iteration before the deadline

## Actions moving forward:
- create new branches and don't commit everything to main right away
