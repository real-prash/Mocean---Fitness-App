            <p class="card-text">Mocean is a fitness app that primarily functions as a simple health and fitness tracker, but it also gives users the ability to dive deep into the world of health and fitness, and broaden their knowledge of living a healthy and active life.</p>

            <p class="card-text">The purpose of Mocean is to lead everyone on an enjoyable journey to reach their health and fitness goals. It is a fitness tracking app that allows its users to track essential information related to their health and fitness journey. Users can track things such as their food and calorie intake, workouts, and progress towards their goals. Mocean is a companion for people of all ages and fitness levels who want to embark on a health and fitness journey, and is designed to meet their specific needs.<br><br>
            The main function of Mocean is to track calorie and macro-nutrient intake per day. Users will be given a recommended amount of daily calories and macro-nutrients based on their height, weight, current health, and goals that they would like to achieve. Users can input what they have eaten in a day from a pre-made list of foods, or they can make a custom food with custom calorie and nutrient information if the food that they have eaten is not listed. The calorie tracking function of Mocean is designed to hold users accountable for their actions and motivate them to stay on track with their health and fitness goals.
            Another major component of Mocean is the workout/exercise section of the app. There will be pre-made workouts that people can browse based on their goals, and an option to create their own workout routines. Users will also be able to track which workouts they have done in a day. Being able to track workouts is yet another way for users to hold themselves accountable for their actions and stay motivated.</p>
